## Introduction:
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity in the 21st century\
This why I chosed **ECOWEATHER** API, that i converted to a DataFrame.\
In this project, we delve into the realm of climate change analysis and energy demand forecasting, aiming to:\

* 🌍 Explore the relationship between weather variables and energy consumption.
* 🌍 Establish a relationship between wind energy production and rain precipitation by analyzing historical data on wind energy production and rain precipitation.
* 🌍 Analyze the impact of climate change on energy demand trends.
* 🌍 Develop predictive models to forecast energy demand under changing climatic conditions.


## Method of Analyzing:

**Temperature Analysis :** Analyze temperature data to identify trends in global warming, using desroptives analysis.
